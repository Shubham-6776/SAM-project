  1> This project is short and simple to understand takes a few minutes to execute.
  2> This code will not need any extra dependencies to install,as long as you run this in latest python version 3.9.7 that is sufficient.
  3> so here we have FOUR files named MAIN.py, READ.py, WRITE.py, PURCHASE.py 
  4> By importing those 3 files read, write and purchase in “MAIN”  and followed by the while loop the procedure is done.
  5> The output shows us the items which the buyer is willing to buy and acoording to the choice of user the code will first greet the customer and ask for his choice,
     It will give the customer the options to offer the discount according to total amount and show the remaining products,
     and at end it will also create a text document for the invoice for the shopping done.
